# PCOS-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
In my exploration of PCOS prediction based on a literature survey, various machine learning algorithms, including Gradient Boosting, SVM, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and a hybrid RF-LR model, were investigated. Remarkably, the Decision Tree model consistently demonstrated superior accuracy, outperforming other methods. This finding, drawn from existing research, highlights the robustness of decision tree-based approaches in the context of PCOS prediction. Such insights contribute to the ongoing efforts to leverage machine learning for early detection and improved management of PCOS in women.
